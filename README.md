## Building

Clone the repo and partake in some good old fashioned cmake fun

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

## Testing

```
cd build/test
make
```

After that, all you have to do is `#include <cuteop.h>` in your project. Cute-Op can be used as it exists in a git submodule, or your can use it in your own cool way.
